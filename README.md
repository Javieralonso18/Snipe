# SnipeFramework
Framework MVC in PHP. I extracted from phpacademy.org and i added some things of Laravel Framework

-- IMPORTANT --
If you clone the project, you need change the .htaccess file in app/public location, in the line RewriteBase.You need to replace 'snipeframework/public' with 'your-project-directory/public' if you wanna move the contents of the 
project.
